# Project Planning Matrix - Lubbock Florist Online Order Management

## Project Context
Based on the Lubbock Florist Business Case prepared by Scott Weeden (July 15, 2025)

### Current State Challenges:
- Order Processing Accuracy: 85% (causing duplicates and errors)
- Inventory Accuracy: 60% (leading to stockouts)
- Order Fulfillment Time: 45 minutes
- Peak Season Stockouts: 8-10 incidents

## MOV Statement (from Business Case)
"Improve operational efficiency by reducing order processing errors to less than 1% and decreasing order fulfillment time by 40% within 6 months of system implementation, while maintaining 95% inventory accuracy to prevent stockouts during peak seasons."

## Alternatives Being Evaluated
1. **Alternative 1**: Cloud-Based System (Buy)
2. **Alternative 2**: Custom Database (Develop)
3. **Alternative 3**: Enhanced Excel (Remodel)
4. **Alternative 4**: Status Quo (Do Nothing)

## Weighted Scoring Analysis (Scale: 1-10, where 10 is best)

### 1. Likelihood of Achieving MOV (Weight: 30%)

| Alternative | Score | Justification |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| **Alt 1: Cloud-Based** | 9 | • **Very High Success Rate**: Cloud systems proven in floral industry<br>• **Quick Implementation**: 6-month timeline fits MOV perfectly<br>• **All Targets Achievable**: 99% accuracy, 40% time reduction, 95% inventory accuracy all realistic<br>• **Vendor Support**: Professional implementation ensures success |
| **Alt 2: Custom Database** | 5 | • **Moderate Likelihood**: Can achieve goals but risky timeline<br>• **Development Uncertainty**: Custom coding may exceed 6 months<br>• **Testing Delays**: Bug fixes could push beyond MOV deadline<br>• **Perfect Fit If Completed**: Would match exact business needs |
| **Alt 3: Enhanced Excel** | 3 | • **Low Probability**: Excel limitations prevent achieving 99% accuracy<br>• **Manual Processes Remain**: Can't fully automate order flow<br>• **Inventory Challenges**: Real-time tracking nearly impossible<br>• **Partial Improvements Only**: Maybe 90% accuracy, 20% time reduction |
| **Alt 4: Status Quo** | 0 | • **Zero Chance**: Current 85% accuracy can't reach 99% target<br>• **No Time Improvement**: Manual processes remain at 45 minutes<br>• **Worsening Situation**: Growing order volume will decrease performance<br>• **MOV Completely Unachievable**: All targets will be missed |

### 2. Project Risk (Weight: 15%)
*Note: Higher score = Lower risk (better)*

| Alternative | Score | Key Risks Identified |
|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| **Alt 1: Cloud-Based** | 8 | • **Low Implementation Risk**: Proven systems with established processes<br>• **Vendor Reliability**: SLA agreements provide protection<br>• **Data Migration**: Some risk but vendor tools help<br>• **User Adoption**: Training included, change management support |
| **Alt 2: Custom Database** | 3 | • **High Technical Risk**: Need skilled developers familiar with floral industry<br>• **Budget Overrun Risk**: Document shows this often exceeds by 50-100%<br>• **Timeline Risk**: Complex features cause delays<br>• **Maintenance Burden**: Ongoing developer dependency forever |
| **Alt 3: Enhanced Excel** | 6 | • **Moderate Technical Risk**: Excel expertise readily available<br>• **Scalability Risk**: Will hit Excel limits as business grows<br>• **Data Corruption Risk**: Multiple users can cause conflicts<br>• **Integration Limits**: Can't connect to payment systems easily |
| **Alt 4: Status Quo** | 2 | • **Business Continuity Risk**: Competitors gaining market share<br>• **Data Loss Risk**: Paper orders damaged/lost (water, misplacement)<br>• **Staff Burnout Risk**: Can't handle peak seasons effectively<br>• **Revenue Loss Risk**: $25,000 in stockout losses over 3 years |

### 3. Customer Satisfaction (Weight: 25%)

| Alternative | Score | Customer Impact Factors |
|-------------|-------|------------------------|
| **Alt 1: Cloud-Based** | 9 | • **Professional Experience**: Customers get modern e-commerce interface<br>• **Real-time Updates**: Order confirmations, delivery tracking<br>• **Accurate Inventory**: Shows what's actually available today<br>• **24/7 Ordering**: Shop anytime, not just business hours<br>• **Fewer Errors**: 99% accuracy means happy customers |
| **Alt 2: Custom Database** | 7 | • **Tailored Experience**: Custom features for local market<br>• **Visual Customization**: Could build arrangement designer<br>• **Integration Potential**: Connect with wedding planners<br>• **Risk of Delays**: Customers wait longer for improvements |
| **Alt 3: Enhanced Excel** | 4 | • **Minimal Improvement**: Still mostly phone/in-person orders<br>• **No Online Access**: Customers can't self-serve<br>• **Limited Tracking**: No automatic status updates<br>• **Continued Errors**: Maybe 90% accuracy vs 99% target |
| **Alt 4: Status Quo** | 2 | • **Poor Experience**: 15% error rate frustrates customers<br>• **Phone Bottlenecks**: Busy signals during peak times<br>• **No Visibility**: Can't check order status<br>• **Stockout Disappointments**: 8-10 incidents per peak season<br>• **Lost Customers**: Switching to competitors with online ordering |

## Financial Context (from Business Case)
| Metric | Alt 1 | Alt 2 | Alt 3 | Alt 4 |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 3-Year TCO | $14,300 | $29,500 | $11,500 | $25,000 |
| 3-Year Net Benefit | $39,700 | $24,500 | $15,500 | -$25,000 |
| ROI | 278% | 83% | 135% | -100% |
| Payback Period | 4 months | 16 months | 8 months | Never |

## Weighted Score Calculation

| Criteria | Weight | Alt 1: Cloud | Alt 2: Custom | Alt 3: Excel | Alt 4: Status Quo |
|----------|--------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| MOV Achievement | 30% | 9 × 0.30 = 2.70 | 5 × 0.30 = 1.50 | 3 × 0.30 = 0.90 | 0 × 0.30 = 0.00 |
| Risk Management | 15% | 8 × 0.15 = 1.20 | 3 × 0.15 = 0.45 | 6 × 0.15 = 0.90 | 2 × 0.15 = 0.30 |
| Customer Satisfaction | 25% | 9 × 0.25 = 2.25 | 7 × 0.25 = 1.75 | 4 × 0.25 = 1.00 | 2 × 0.25 = 0.50 |
| **Subtotal (70%)** | **70%** | **6.15** | **3.70** | **2.80** | **0.80** |

*Note: This analysis covers 70% of the total weight. The business case includes additional criteria like ROI (scored in their matrix as 9, 6, 7, 0) and Strategic Fit (scored as 9, 8, 5, 2).*
